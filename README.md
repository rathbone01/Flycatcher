# flycatcher

## What is flycatcher?
flycatcher is an opensource messaging app with servers and channels to connect with friends written in C#. The UI is Active Server Side Rendered Blazor using MudBlazor as a component library.

## What is the goal of this project?
My goal for flycatcher is to have fun programming an application in C# to expand my skills and if I do it long enough have a functional app for at least my friends.

## Can I contribute?
I dunno, sure? I have never collaberated on open source projects so I am still learning how to setup branch rules and things.

## What is the next planned features?
Moderation tools, abilty to delete messages, UI fixes, and adding unit tests.
